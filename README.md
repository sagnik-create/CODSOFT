# Codsoft_intern
## Task 1 
The task was building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. To achieve this I had to use if-else statements which was used to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This gave me a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.
